This file illustartes how to compile and excute the Breadth First Search, Ford Fulkerson and Image Segmentation Algorithms :

Create a separate folder for each algorithm and place the file in it. The project is developed using java and we insist to use Eclipse.


*************  Read me Breadth First Search **********************
	 
bfs.java
•	Load the file into eclipse and right click on the java file and click on run configurations 
•	input the source node and the destination node  as arguments.
•	Ex:  2 5
•	Then run the file and check the path in the console.


*************  Read me Ford-Fulkerson algorithm **********************

FFS.java
•	Load the file into eclipse and right click on the java file and click on run configurations.
• 	input the file name (the file should be placed inside the project folder and outside the src folder. the input file should have an extra space in the end)
•	This would give you the maximum flow for the graph in the console.


*************  Read me Breadth First Search **********************

ImgSegment.java
•	Load the file into eclipse and right click on the java file and click on run configurations 
•	Then input the arguments as 
Source_filename.pgm    destination_filename.pgm
•	Then allocate the extra heap space by typing the following argument  in the VM arguments
-Xss32m
•	Then run the following file and check the output in the destination.
